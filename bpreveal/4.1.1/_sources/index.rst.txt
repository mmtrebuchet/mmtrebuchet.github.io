BPReveal Documentataion
=======================

BPReveal is a suite of tools for working with sequence-to-profile models in the vein of
BPNet.

It incorporates bias correction in the style of chrombpnet-lite, but with added features
to regress out very complex biases.

It also incorporates a new interpretation tool, called :doc:`PISA<_generated/pisa>` (Pairwise
Interaction Shap Analysis) that lets you view a two-dimensional map of cause
and effect over a region.

The components of BPReveal are divided based on how you use them.

Main
    These components are command-line tools that take JSON files for configuration.
Utility
    These are command-line tools that take command-line flags.
API
    These are importable Python libraries.
Tools
    Tools are assorted programs that are occasionally useful, but not actively maintained.
    There are Main Tools, Utility Tools, and API tools.
Internal API
    These are used inside BPReveal, but are not needed for user code.
