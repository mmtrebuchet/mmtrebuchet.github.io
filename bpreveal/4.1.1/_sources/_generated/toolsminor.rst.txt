These are various programs that I have found useful, but can't commit to fully
maintaining.
These take command-line flags. For example,

.. highlight:: none

::

   tileGenome --genome dm6.fa --all-chroms --output-length 1000 --output-bed tiled.bed



.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :hidden:

    lossWeights
    revcompTools
    shiftBigwigs
    tileGenome
